# Hey, I'm Sujith Srikar  

I’m a coder who gets things done—sometimes before I even realize I need to. I keep things simple, efficient, and, of course, sprinkled with just the right amount of chaos.  

I build things that work (most of the time), fix bugs that shouldn’t exist, and spend half my life wondering why something that worked yesterday is broken today.  

## Who I Am  

- **Efficient Problem Solver:** I solve problems quickly—usually after breaking something else in the process.  
- **Tech Enthusiast:** If there’s a new framework, I’ll try it. If there’s a new trend, I’ll probably regret trying it.  
- **Master of Ambition:** I do DSA, design, and Web3… all at once, because who needs a sense of focus? (Spoiler: I do. Just realized that.)  
- **Lover of Down-to-Earth Ideas (That Somehow Always Fly Too High):** Every time, I start small. A simple project. And then—boom—I’m halfway into building a decentralized AI-powered metaverse. Reality always catches up, usually around submission time.  
- **Debugging Prodigy:** 80% of my job is fixing bugs. 20% is trying to understand how those bugs even got there in the first place.  
- **Relentless Builder:** I don’t stop until the output is exactly what it should be. Good enough? Never heard of it. If it’s not working, I tweak, fix, and refine until it’s not just done—it’s *right*.  

## What I Do  

I build websites, applications, and solutions that *mostly* work. I write clean, efficient code until I look at it three months later and wonder who let me near a keyboard. I believe in continuous learning, even if that means realizing too late that I should’ve just focused on *one* thing at a time.  

But here’s the thing—I deliver. I take projects from wild ideas to solid, working products. If there’s a challenge, I don’t back down. I refine, optimize, and push until what I build isn’t just functional but truly great.

Got a wild idea? Let’s build it. Just know that we’ll probably overscope it, underestimate the time needed, and regret everything—right before pulling off a last-minute save.
